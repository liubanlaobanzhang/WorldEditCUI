ã€‚
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEditCUI/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEditCUI/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A graphical user interface for [WorldEdit]. WorldEditCUI is designed 
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

Please note that this is not [WorldEdit], which allows you to make changes
to your world, but WorldEditCUI, a frontend for WorldEdit. You must have
WorldEdit installed on your server.
 
Installation
------------

1. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use)
2. Install [Fabric API mod](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric) into Minecraft mods folder
3. Install [this mod](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEditCUI/releases) into Minecraft mods folder

WorldEdit selections will be shown without any configuration necessary, but the colours used are configurable as long as [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) is installed.

Compiling
---------

Run `_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx2G" ./gradlew build`

To import the project into your IDE, see [FabricMC Wiki article](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) and start from **Step 3**
